## Project Description

The goal of this project is to make an e-commerce platform that emulates an armory selling different weapons and armors to inter-planetary travellers, each with their own needs. Each item has their own unique attributes (properties, damage/damage types, abilities) that can be combined with attachments/modifiers (serration, extra plating, enchantments, etc) for maximum customer satisfaction. Some travellers will fight off different horrors on different planets, and each one has their own strengths and weaknesses.
