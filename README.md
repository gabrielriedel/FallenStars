## Project Description

The goal of this project is to make an e-commerce platform that emulates an armory selling different weapons and armors to inter-planetary travellers, each with their own needs. Each item has their own unique attributes (properties, damage/damage types, abilities) that can be combined with attachments/modifiers (serration, extra plating, enchantments, etc) for maximum customer satisfaction.

Possible ideas to further complicate/deviate from Potion Exchange:
- Purchasing items from customers to add to the supply
- Rent out items and have them returned after a sum amount of ticks
- Sales! Have prices lowered on specific days
