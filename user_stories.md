## User Story Samples
1. I am a thief who wants to protect themselves when travelling, while also keeping my arms discreetly hidden. That way, I can keep myself protected no matter where I go, even after going through security clearance.
2. I am a warrior from a far off planet made almost entirely of ice. I want to use a melee weapon for honors' sake and wield fiery weaponry to be more effective against my foes.
3. I am a monk who travels into the darkest, most dangerous parts of the solar system. Without appearing menacing or troublesome, I need a tough sort of armor to keep me safe. One of the planets I'm going to also has a corrosive, dangerous atmosphere.
4. As a sea-dwelling siren, I want a rust-free clarion so that I can continue to make loud, clear calls throughout my territory. 
5. As a mighty ogre, I want special-made protective armor so that I can defend unusally my large frame from dangerous enemies. 
6. As a desert-dwelling nomad, I want a weather-resistant compass so that I can navigate my perilous arid terrain. 
7. As a wise wizard, I want an omniscient orb so that I can spy on my enemies and protect my coven.
8. As a prideful barbarian, I want bright, gleaming armor so enemies will fear my strength.

10. As a bard, I want new instruments so I can motivate and revigorate my companions more effectively.

## Exceptions

Possible ideas to further complicate/deviate from Potion Exchange:
1. Purchasing items from customers to add to the supply
2. Rent out items and have them returned after a sum amount of ticks
3. Sales! Have prices lowered on specific days
4. Exception: Bundle purchasing
Certain combinations of products lower their combined price. This discounting will be
applied automatically during the checkout process. 
5. Exception: Different currencies
Customers from different planets may not use the same currency as our platform. In this 
circumstance, a conversion will be automatically applied during checkout.
6. Exception: Ability-verification
Certain items are only available to properly-trained customers. Competence-checking will
occur for these specific items before the completion of sale.
7. Exception: Insufficient funds received
Some customers are sneaky and may attempt to buy items for less than they are being sold for. Our shop will automatically detect if someone does not provide enough currency for a purchase.
8. Exception: Attempted to sell a low-quality item
Some items may deteriorate after being in our inventory for too long. If we try to sell something that is faulty, we will be notified to replace the item with a new one or at a discount.
9. Exception: Item is over-priced
Customers may know other shops that sell what they want at lower prices. Our shop will provide a discount to individuals who do not want to buy items because they know they can find better deals elsewhere.
