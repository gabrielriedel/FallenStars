## User Story Samples
1. I am a thief who wants to protect themselves when travelling, while also keeping my arms discreetly hidden. That way, I can keep myself protected no matter where I go, even after going through security clearance.
2. I am a warrior from a far off planet made almost entirely of ice. I want to use a melee weapon for honors' sake and wield fiery weaponry to be more effective against my foes.
3. I am a monk who travels into the darkest, most dangerous parts of the solar system. Without appearing menacing or troublesome, I need a tough sort of armor to keep me safe. One of the planets I'm going to also has a corrosive, dangerous atmosphere.
4. As a sea-dwelling siren, I want a rust-free clarion so that I can continue to make loud, clear calls throughout my territory. 
5. As a mighty ogre, I want special-made protective armor so that I can defend unusally my large frame from dangerous enemies. 
6. As a desert-dwelling nomad, I want a weather-resistant compass so that I can navigate my perilous arid terrain. 
7. As a wise wizard, I want an omniscient orb so that I can spy on my enemies and protect my coven.

## Exceptions

Possible ideas to further complicate/deviate from Potion Exchange:
1. Purchasing items from customers to add to the supply
2. Rent out items and have them returned after a sum amount of ticks
3. Sales! Have prices lowered on specific days

4. Bundle purchasing: certain combinations of products lower their combined price
5. Different currencies: customers from different planets may not use the same currency (?)
6. Ability-verification: certain items are only available to properly-trained customers. This 
competence needs to be checked before completion of sale.
